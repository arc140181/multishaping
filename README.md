# Multishaping
VHDL code for Multishaping algorithm. Created with Xilinx Vivado and exportable to any architecture with enough resources to host this project.

- *shaper.vhd*. Finite Impulse Respose (FIR) shaper.
- *pha.vhd*. Pulse height analiser.
- *fsm.vhd*. Finite state machine.
- *top.vhd*. The entire triplicated detection chain.
- *top_tb.vhd*. Testbench of the detection chain.
- *.txt*. Example pulses.
